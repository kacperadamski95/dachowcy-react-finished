Recoding website to react
This is my first website created with react.
Assumptions for this project was to create website which looks simple (customers who owner wanted to target are older people) and contains all required informations, photos, alt's, descriptions of realizations with smuggled keywords in text and in <head> to improve SEO and google search - which is working pretty well - despite paid search in google (google Ads) - website position in google is strong.
Most important is SEO and mobile view which are working well - desktop display is a little bit "wooden" - but as I said, client wanted to have simple view with big fonts which is easy to navigate for older people.
